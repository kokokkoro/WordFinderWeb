For this word search tool, the kazakh words array from 
qate.js repository owned by jarjan (github user) was used 
as a dictionary.

This is a simple and functional tool for searching words 
in Kazakh language. No instructions are required due to the 
intuitive interface. If any errors occur while using the tool, 
I'm sorry. I can't help you, I'm unlikely to return to this 
project again.
